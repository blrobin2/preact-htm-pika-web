# Preact X, HTM, @pika/web
I had trouble finding an example of `preact`, `htm` and `@pika/web` working together the way I wanted. It's not inherently difficult, I just had to look around to understand what I was doing

## Prior Art
* The `preact` code is based on [Kent Dodd's The State Reducer Pattern with React Hooks article](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks).
* The `@pika/web documentation` has [an example of `htm` and `preact`](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/pika-web-example-preact-htm?path=script.js:1:0)
* A sample of `htm` and `preact` came from [this sandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/embed/k3q4yv0rlr?codemirror=1)
* Example of how to use Hooks in `preact` came from [the Preact 10 release tag](https://github.com/developit/preact/releases/tag/10.0.0-alpha.0)
* How to get nested folder dependencies working with `@pika/web` came from [this pull request on the @pika/web repo](https://github.com/pikapkg/web/pull/24)
